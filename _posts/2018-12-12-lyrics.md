Are songs getting more repetitive?

<center><hr style="width:50%"></center>
<br>

People of the older generation (a bracket I suppose I'm quickly moving towards) often complain that music now isn't as good as it was back in their day. It's a fairly silly thing to say, and one frequent aspect of the griping is that music is getting more repetitive. But unlike most subjective complaints about music, this is something that we can actually test empirically.

To do this I went out and got some data on song lyrics. Looking around online I found the lyrics to all songs that have charted in the Billboard Top 100 1964-2015,  

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Rank</th>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Lyrics</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Wooly Bully</td>
      <td>Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs</td>
      <td>1965</td>
      <td>Wooly bully wooly b...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>I can't help myself (sugar pie, honey bunch)</td>
      <td>Four Tops</td>
      <td>1965</td>
      <td>Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love yo...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>I can't get no satisfaction</td>
      <td>The Rolling Stones</td>
      <td>1965</td>
      <td>I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no ...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>You were on my mind</td>
      <td>We five</td>
      <td>1965</td>
      <td>When I woke up this morning you were on my mi...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>You've lost that lovin' feelin'</td>
      <td>The Righteous Brothers</td>
      <td>1965</td>
      <td>You never close your eyes anymore when i kiss...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So let's dig in to this data and see what we can see. For instance are songs getting longer? Let's split the lyrics into words and count how many there are

```python
df["Length"] = df.Lyrics.str.split().apply(len)
df.groupby("Decade").Length.mean()
```
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>Decade</th>
      <th>Length</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>1960s</th>
      <td>199.603070</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1970s</th>
      <td>233.740659</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1980s</th>
      <td>272.368697</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1990s</th>
      <td>365.427966</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2000s</th>
      <td>464.262076</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2010s</th>
      <td>412.250847</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So it looks like songs are getting longer at least, not discounting the small downturn we've got in the last 5 years of data. This is a pretty crude measure though, just looking at how many words is in a song doesn't tell us anything about how repetitive it is. One thing that we can look at is how many *different* words are in a song

```python
df['Unique Words'] = df.Lyrics.str.split().apply(set).apply(len)
df.plot(x='Year', y='Unique Words', kind='scatter')
```

Cool! It seems that songs actually are getting less repetitious, songs today contain more different words than they did 50 years ago. This is interesting, but it is actually a kinda crude metric for repetition.

A cleverer way to measure how much repetition there is in a string is to see how easily that string can be compressed. And the nice thing about this is that it doesn't require that a word be repeated exactly for us to compress it; that is 'love' and 'loving' aren't the same word, but a good compression algorithm will notice that they're very similar and count that as a type of repetition.

We can easily apply compression to our lyrics, and see what we getting
```python
import zlib

def compress(x):
    return zlib.compress(bytes(x, 'utf8'))

df['Compress Length'] = df.Lyrics.astype(str).apply(compress).apply(len)
```

Now the picture looks a little different. What I've plotted here is "compression ratio", which is the length of the song pre-compression / length post-compression, and we see that there's a trend towards songs being **more** compressible -- and so, we infer, more repetitious. One thing you'll notice is that the songs that we find hard to compress are those with very few lyrics. The least compressible song is *Also Sprach Zarathustra* by Eumir Deodato, which I hadn't heard of before, but is a mostly instrumental track and since it doesn't have many lyrics it's hard for the compression algorithm to find repetition.

Just taking two decades, the first and the last, we can plot up the distribution of compression

![compress](/images/lyrics/compression.png)

And we can apply a Student's t-test to the means of these distribution and come to the (obvious) conclusion that there is a significant difference between these decades.

So there we have it, incontrovertible proof that music is getting worse.
